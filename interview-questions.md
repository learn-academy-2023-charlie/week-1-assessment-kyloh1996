# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

<!-- Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:
Git is an open source program that allows you to store code and create branches inorder to protect the source code... Github is a website that uses the git software, and its free... 

Researched answer:
Git is a version control system while github is a web based platform that hostsgit repositories. The host provides a platform that allows for remote collaberation.  

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
comparison operators 

Researched answer:
Some JavaScript operators return boolean values. These include comparison operators, logical operators, the typeof operator, the instanceof operator, and the ternary operator. Comparison operators compare two values and return true or false. Logical operators combine or negate boolean values and produce a boolean result. The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of a value but can also be used to check whether a variable is defined or not. The instanceof operator tests whether an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor function and returns a boolean value. The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if...else statement and returns a boolean value based on a condition.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer:
array index is the index location of a specific value, staring from 0. 
value is whats indexed
Researched answer:

In JavaScript, an array index is a zero-based integer that identifies the position of an element within an array, while an index value is the value of the element located at that position. For instance, in an array `myArray` with elements `[10, 20, 30]`, the index value of the first element located at index `0` is `10`.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer:
strings are represented with the quotation mark operater "", whereas arrays use brackets []
strings have one value within, whereas arrays can have multiple
Both are dataTypes

Researched answer:
Arrays and strings are two types of data structures in JavaScript. They share some similarities such as being ordered collections of data with a length property, square bracket notation, and various methods for manipulating their contents. However, they differ in several ways. Arrays can contain any type of data and are mutable, while strings can only contain characters and are immutable. Arrays are typically used for storing collections of related data, while strings are used for representing text. Arrays can be sparse while strings are always densely packed. Arrays have more built-in methods for manipulating their contents, while strings rely on regular expressions and string methods like `split()` and `substring()`.
 
5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?


Your answer:
you have a driver and a navigator 
propper pair programing has ample communication- you are working together to create code and roles switch periodically 
the driver is the hand on person, typing the code 
the navagator guides the driver, providing the direction of the code -- relaying information
Researched answer:
Pair programming is a software development method where two programmers collaborate by working together on a single computer or through a medium to complete a task. To ensure effective pair programming, it's important to have good communication and collaboration skills, switch roles frequently, test the code, review the code together, and integrate code changes into a shared repository regularly. Pair programming can be beneficial for software development because it improves code quality, reduces development time, and promotes knowledge sharing among programmers.
In pair programming, the two programmers take on different roles: the driver and the navigator. The driver is responsible for coding, while the navigator reviews the code and provides feedback. The navigator may also research solutions and offer support to the driver. The roles can be switched frequently to ensure both programmers have an opportunity to contribute. Pair programming helps improve code quality, reduce development time, and promote knowledge sharing. -->
 
<!-- ## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:

2. Jest: jest is the spellcheck of coding in JavaScript. It is a testing framework for code to ensure its workability. Many major social media platforms use this framework. 

3. Objects: This is a JavaScript datatype that can contain collections. Objects may holds particular information that makes it the the brdge between data and behavior. 

4. Method: methods are associated an object. They can be called on using .notation(). Methods are what allow objects to have behaviors associated with them, and can alter the objects state or return value.

**** The .map() I found the other day!!!!! :) 

5. Classes: Classes define blueprints for objects with similar properties and behavior. Classes are defined usinging the 'class' keyword and have the ability to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes using an 'extends' keyword.  -->
